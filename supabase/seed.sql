-- Seed data for development and testing
-- This file contains sample data to help with development

-- Insert test users (these will be created through Supabase Auth in development)
-- The profiles will be created automatically via the trigger

-- Sample contact groups (will be created after users sign up)
-- This is just for reference - actual groups should be created through the application

-- Sample notification events and SMS logs can be added here for testing
-- But they should primarily be created through the application flow

-- You can add any static reference data here if needed in the future

-- For now, this file serves as a placeholder for future seed data
